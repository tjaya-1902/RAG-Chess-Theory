0,En passant,Rule,"When a pawn advances two squares on its initial move and ends the turn adjacent to an enemy pawn on the same rank, it may be captured (en passant) by the enemy pawn as if it had moved only one square. This capture is legal only on the move immediately following the pawn's advance.",
1,Check,Rule,"A king is in check when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check (it is pinned against its own king) may still deliver check to the opposing player. It is illegal to make a move that places or leaves one's king in check. The possible ways to get out of check are: - Move the king to a square where it is not in check. \n- Capture the checking piece. \n- Interpose a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece (block the check). \n In informal games, it is customary to announce ""check"" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced.",
2,Promotion,Rule,"If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then promoted (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player (a queen is most common). The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of the player's pawns are promoted.",
3,Checkmate,Rule,"If a player's king is placed in check and there is no legal move that player can make to escape check, then the king is said to be checkmated, the game ends, and that player loses. Unlike the other pieces, the king is never captured.",
4,Resigning,Rule,"Either player may resign at any time, conceding the game to the opponent. To indicate resignation, the player may say ""I resign"". Tipping over the king also indicates resignation, but it should be distinguished from accidentally knocking the king over. Stopping both clocks is not an indication of resigning, since clocks can be stopped to call the arbiter. An offer of a handshake is sometimes used, but it could be mistaken for a draw offer. Under FIDE Laws, a resignation by one player results in a draw if their opponent has no way to checkmate them via any series of legal moves, or a loss by that player otherwise.",
5,Draws,Rule,"The game ends in a draw if any of these conditions occur: \n-The player to move is not in check and has no legal move. This situation is called a stalemate. \n-The game reaches a dead position. \n-Both players agree to a draw after one of the players makes such an offer. \nIn addition, in the FIDE rules, if a player has run out of time, or has resigned, but the position is such that there is no way for the opponent to give checkmate by any series of legal moves, the game is a draw. \nFIDE's competitive rules of play allow a player to claim a draw in either of two situations: \n-Fifty moves have been made by each player without a capture or pawn movement (this is the fifty-move rule). \n-The same position has appeared three times (or has appeared twice and the player claiming the draw can force the third appearance); this is the threefold repetition rule. \nThese rules help prevent games from being extended indefinitely in tournaments. \nThere is no longer a rule specifically defining perpetual check as a draw. In such a situation, either the threefold repetition rule or the fifty-move rule will eventually come into effect. More often, the players will simply agree to a draw.",
6,Board,Rule,"Chess is played on a chessboard, a square board divided into a grid of 64 squares (eight-by-eight) of alternating color (similar to the board used in draughts).Regardless of the actual colors of the board, the lighter-colored squares are called ""light"" or ""white"", and the darker-colored squares are called ""dark"" or ""black"". Sixteen ""white"" and sixteen ""black"" pieces are placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The board is placed so that a white square is in each player's near-right corner. Horizontal rows are called ranks, and vertical columns are called files.",
7,Win,Rule,"A game can be won in the following ways: \n-Checkmate: The opposing king is in check and the opponent has no legal move. \n-Resignation: A player may resign, conceding the game to the opponent. If, however, the opponent has no way of checkmating the resigned player, this is a draw under FIDE Laws. Most tournament players consider it good etiquette to resign in a hopeless position. \n-Win on time: In games with a time control, a player wins if the opponent runs out of time, even if the opponent has a superior position, as long as the player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent were the game to continue. \n-Forfeit: A player who cheats, violates the rules, or violates the rules of conduct specified for the particular tournament can be forfeited. Occasionally, both players are forfeited.",
8,Time Control,Rule,"In competition, chess games are played with a time control. Time controls are generally divided into categories based on the amount of time given to each player, which range from classical time controls, which allot about 2 hours or more to each player and which can take upwards of seven hours (even longer if adjournments are permitted), to bullet chess, in which players receive less than three minutes each. Between these are�rapid chess�(ten to sixty minutes per player), popular in amateur tournaments, and�blitz chess�(three to ten minutes), popular online. Non-classical chess is sometimes referred to as�fast chess.",
9,King,Piece,"The king is the most important piece in the game of chess. It may move to any adjoining square; it may also perform, in tandem with the rook, a special move called castling. If a player's king is threatened with capture, it is said to be in check, and the player must remove or evade the threat of capture immediately, such as by moving it away from the attacked square. If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in checkmate, resulting in a loss for that player. A player cannot make any move that places their own king in check. Despite this, the king can become a strong offensive piece in the endgame or, rarely, the middlegame.",
10,Rook,Piece,"The rook is a piece in the game of chess. It may move any number of squares horizontally or vertically without jumping, and it may capture an enemy piece on its path; it may participate in castling. Each player starts the game with two rooks, one in each corner on their side of the board.",
11,Queen,Piece,"The queen is the most powerful piece in the game of chess. It can move any number of squares vertically, horizontally or diagonally, combining the powers of the rook and bishop. Each player starts the game with one queen, placed in the middle of the first rank next to the king. Because the queen is the strongest piece, a pawn is promoted to a queen in the vast majority of cases; if a pawn is promoted to a piece other than a queen, it is an underpromotion.",
12,Pawn,Piece,"The pawn is the most numerous and weakest piece in the game of chess. It may move one square directly forward, it may move two squares directly forward on its first move, and it may capture one square diagonally forward. Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each square of their second rank. The white pawns start on a2 through h2; the black pawns start on a7 through h7.",
13,Bishop,Piece,"The bishop is a piece in the game of chess. It moves and captures along diagonals without jumping over interfering pieces. Each player begins the game with two bishops. The starting squares are c1 and f1 for White's bishops, and c8 and f8 for Black's bishops.",
14,Knight,Piece,"The knight is a piece in the game of chess, represented by a horse's head and neck. It moves two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically, jumping over other pieces. Each player starts the game with two knights on the b- and g-files, each located between a rook and a bishop.",
15,Discovered attack,Tactic,"A discovered attack is a move that allows an attack by another piece. A piece is moved away so as to allow the attack of a friendly bishop, rook or queen on an enemy piece. If the attacked piece is the king, the situation is referred to as a discovered check. Discovered attacks are powerful since the moved piece may be able to pose a second threat.",
16,Fork,Tactic,"A fork is a move that uses one piece to attack two or more of the opponent's pieces simultaneously, with the aim to achieve material advantage, since the opponent can counter only one of the threats. Knights are often used for forks, with their unique moving and jumping ability, which makes them able to attack any enemy piece except for an enemy knight without being attacked in return. The queen is also an excellent forking piece, since she can move in eight different directions. However, a queen fork is only useful if both pieces are undefended, or if one is undefended and the other is the enemy's king. The queen is the most valuable attacking piece, so it is usually not profitable for her to capture a defended piece.",
17,Pin,Tactic,"A pin is a move that inhibits an opponent piece from moving, because doing so would expose a more valuable (or vulnerable) piece behind it. Only bishops, rooks, and queens can perform a pin, since they can move more than one square in a straight line. If the pinned piece cannot move because doing so would produce check, the pin is called absolute. If moving the pinned piece would expose a non-king piece, the pin is called relative.",
18,Skewer,Tactic,"A skewer is a move that attacks two pieces in a line, similar to a pin, except that the enemy piece of greater value is in front of the piece of lesser value. After the more valuable piece moves away, the lesser piece can be captured. Like pins, only queens, rooks, and bishops can perform the skewer, and skewer attacks can be either absolute (the more valuable piece in front is the king, in check) or relative (the piece in front is a non-king piece).",
19,Sacrifices,Tactic,"A sacrifice of some material is often necessary to throw the opponent's position out of balance, potentially gaining positional advantage. The sacrificed material is sometimes later offset with a consequent material gain. Pawn sacrifices in the opening are known as gambits; they are usually not intended for material gain, but rather to achieve a more active position.",
20,Zwischenzug,Tactic,"Zwischenzug (German for ""intermediate move"") is a common tactic in which a player under threat, instead of directly countering or recapturing, introduces an even more devastating threat. The tactic often involves a new attack against the opponent's queen or king. The opponent then may be forced to address the new threat, abandoning the earlier attack.",
21,Zugzwang,Tactic,"Zugzwang (German for ""compulsion to move"") occurs when a player is forced to make an undesirable move. The player is put at a disadvantage because they would prefer to pass and make no move, but a move has to be made, all choices of which weaken their position. Situations involving zugzwang seldom occur before the endgame, where there are fewer choices of available moves.",
22,Opening,Phase,"Sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and are catalogued in reference works, such as the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. There are thousands of openings, though only a small fraction of them are commonly played; variations of openings may also be given names. Openings vary widely in character from quiet positional play (for example, the Rati Opening) to sharp aggressive play (like the Latvian Gambit). In some opening lines, the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves.",
23,Middlegame,Phase,"The middlegame is the part of the game that starts after the opening. Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans based on the features of the position, and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position. The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent's king. Some typical patterns have their own names; for example, the Boden's Mate or the Lasker-Bauer combination.",
24,Endgame,Phase,"The endgame (or end game or ending) is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board. During the endgame, pawns become more important; endgames often revolve around attempting to promote a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank. The king, which must be protected in the middlegame owing to the threat of checkmate, becomes a strong piece in the endgame and it is often brought to the center of the board where it can protect its own pawns, attack the pawns of opposite color, and hinder movement of the opponent's king.",
25,Phases of Chess,Phase,"Chess theory divides chess games into three phases with different sets of strategies: the opening, the middlegame, and lastly the endgame. There is no universally accepted way to delineate the three phases of the game; the middlegame is typically considered to have begun after 10-20 moves, and the endgame when only a few pieces remain.",
26,Exchanging Pieces,Strategy,"To exchange pieces means to capture a hostile piece and then allow a piece of the same value to be captured. As a rule of thumb, exchanging pieces eases the task of the defender who typically has less room to operate in. Exchanging pieces is usually desirable to a player with an existing advantage in material, since it brings the endgame closer and thereby leaves the opponent with less ability to recover ground. In the endgame even a single pawn advantage may be decisive. Exchanging also benefits the player who is being attacked, the player who controls less space, and the player with the better pawn structure.",
27,Defending Pieces,Strategy,"It is important to defend one's pieces even if they are not directly threatened. This helps stop possible future campaigns from the opponent. If a defender must be added at a later time, this may cost a tempo or even be impossible due to a fork or discovered attack. The approach of always defending one's pieces has an antecedent in the theory of Aron Nimzowitsch who referred to it as ""overprotection."" Similarly, if one spots undefended enemy pieces, one should immediately take advantage of those pieces' weakness. Even a defended piece can be vulnerable. If the defending piece is also defending something else, it is called an overworked piece, and may not be able to fulfill its task. When there is more than one attacking piece, the number of defenders must also be increased, and their values taken into account. In addition to defending pieces, it is also often necessary to defend key squares, open files, and the back rank. These situations can easily occur if the pawn structure is weak.",
28,Initiative,Strategy,"The initiative belongs to the player who can make threats that cannot be ignored, such as checking the opponent's king. They thus put their opponent in the position of having to use their turns responding to threats rather than making their own, hindering the development of their pieces. The player with the initiative is generally attacking and the other player is generally defending.",
29,Control of the Center,Strategy,"The strategy consists of placing pieces so that they attack the central four squares of the board. A piece being placed on a central square, however, does not necessarily mean it controls the center; e.g., a knight on a central square does not attack any central squares. Conversely, a piece does not have to be on a central square to control the center. For example, the bishop can control the center from afar. Control of the center is generally considered important because tactical battles often take place around the central squares, from where pieces can access most of the board. Center control allows more movement and more possibility for attack and defense.",
30,What is Chess,Rule,"Chess is a two-player abstract strategy board game. Each player controls sixteen pieces of six types on a chessboard. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king; checkmate occurs when a king is threatened with capture and has no escape. A game can end in various ways besides checkmate: a player can resign, and there are several ways a game can end in a draw.",
31,Open Game,Opening,"White opens by playing 1.e4, which is the most popular opening move and has many strengths. It immediately stakes a claim in the center, and frees two pieces (the queen and king's bishop) for action. An Open Game (or Double King's Pawn Opening) is a generic term for a family of chess openings beginning with the moves: 1. e4 e5",1.e4 e5
32,Ruy Lopez,Opening,"The Ruy Lopez, also called the Spanish Opening or Spanish Game, is a chess opening characterised by the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 \n At the most basic level, White's third move attacks the knight that defends the e5-pawn from the attack by the f3-knight. White's apparent threat to win Black's e-pawn with 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.Nxe5 is illusory, Black can respond 5...Qd4, forking the knight and e4-pawn, winning back the material with a good position. White's 3.Bb5 is still a good move, however; it develops a piece, prepares castling, and sets up a potential pin against Black's king. Since White's third move carries no immediate threat, Black can respond in a wide variety of ways. \n The theory of the Ruy Lopez is the most extensively developed of all Open Games, with some lines having been analysed well beyond move thirty. At nearly every move there are many reasonable alternatives, and most have been deeply explored.",1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5
33,Scotch Game,Opening,"The Scotch Game, or Scotch Opening, is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4\n White aims to dominate the centre by exchanging their d-pawn for Black's e-pawn. Black usually plays 3...exd4, as they have no good way of maintaining their pawn on e5 (this same position can be reached by transposition from the Centre Game 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Nf3 Nc6). After the usual 3...exd4, White can respond with the main line 4.Nxd4 or can play a gambit by offering Black one or two pawns in exchange for rapid development.",1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4
34,Italian Game,Opening,"The Italian Game is a family of chess openings beginning with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4\n This opening is defined by the development of the white bishop to c4 (the so-called ""Italian bishop""), where it attacks Black's vulnerable f7-square. It is part of the large family of Open Games or Double King's Pawn Games.",1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4
35,Four Knights Game,Opening,"The Four Knights Game is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 \n This is the most common sequence, but the knights may develop in any order to reach the same position. The Four Knights usually leads to quiet positional play, though there are also some sharp variations. The opening is fairly popular with beginners who strictly adhere to the opening principle: ""Develop knights before bishops.""",1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6
36,Petrov's Defence,Opening,"Petrov's Defence or the Petrov Defence (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game) is a chess opening characterised by the following moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6\n Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularised by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player in the mid-19th century. In recognition of the early investigations by the Russian masters Petrov and Carl Jaenisch, this opening is called the Russian Game in some countries.",1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6
37,Philidor Defence,Opening,"The Philidor Defence (or Philidor's Defence) is a chess opening characterised by the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6\n The opening is named after the famous 18th-century player Francois-Andre Danican Philidor, who advocated it as an alternative to the common 2...Nc6. His original idea was to challenge White's centre by the pawn thrust ...f7-f5. Today, the Philidor is known as a solid but passive choice for Black, and is seldom seen in top-level play except as an alternative to the heavily analysed openings that can ensue after the normal 2...Nc6. It is considered a good opening for amateur players who seek a defensive strategy that is simpler and easier to understand than the complex positions that result from an opening such as the French Defence.",1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6
38,Vienna Game,Opening,"The Vienna Game is an opening in chess that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nc3\n White's second move is less common than 2.Nf3, and is also more recent. The original idea behind the Vienna Game was to play a delayed King's Gambit with f4 (the Vienna Gambit), but in modern play White often plays more quietly (for example, by fianchettoing their king's bishop with g3 and Bg2). Black most often continues with 2...Nf6. ",1.e4 e5 2.Nc3
39,Bishop's Opening,Opening,"The Bishop's Opening is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Bc4\nWhite attacks Black's f7-square and prevents Black from advancing the d-pawn to d5. By ignoring the beginner's maxim ""develop knights before bishops"", White leaves their f-pawn unblocked, preserving the possibility of f2-f4. The f2-f4 push gives the Bishop's Opening an affinity with the King's Gambit and the Vienna Game, two openings that share this characteristic. The Bishop's Opening can transpose into either of these openings, and in particular a favorable variation of the King's Gambit, but with care Black can circumvent this. Transpositions into the Giuoco Piano and the Two Knights Defense and other openings are also possible.",1.e4 e5 2.Bc4
40,King's Gambit,Opening,"The King's Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. f4\nWhite offers a pawn to divert the black e-pawn. If Black accepts the gambit, White may play d4 and Bxf4, regaining the gambit pawn with central domination, or direct their forces against the weak square f7 with moves such as Nf3, Bc4, 0-0, and g3. A downside to the King's Gambit is that it weakens White's king's position, exposing it to the latent threat of ...Qh4+ (or ...Be7 h4+), which may force White to give up castling rights.",1.e4 e5 2.f4
41,Center Game,Opening,"The Center Game is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4\nThe game usually continues 3.Qxd4 Nc6, developing with a gain of tempo for Black due to the attack on the white queen. (Note that 3.c3 is considered a separate opening: the Danish Gambit.)",1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Qxd4
42,Danish Gambit,Opening,"The Danish Gambit, known as the Nordisches Gambit in German and the Noords Gambiet in Dutch (both meaning Nordic Gambit), is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3\nWhite will sacrifice one or two pawns for the sake of rapid development and the attack. However, with care, Black can accept one or both pawns safely, or simply decline the gambit altogether with good chances.",1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3
43,Sicilian Defence,Opening,"The Sicilian Defence is a chess opening that begins with the following moves: 1. e4 c5\nBy advancing the c-pawn two squares, Black asserts control over the d4-square and begins the fight for the centre of the board. The move resembles 1.e5, the next most common response to 1.e4, in that respect. Unlike 1...e5, however, 1...c5 breaks the symmetry of the position, which strongly influences both players' future actions. White, having pushed a kingside pawn, tends to hold the initiative on that side of the board. However, 1...c5 does little for Black's development, unlike moves such as 1...e5, 1...g6, or 1...Nc6, which either develop a minor piece or prepare to do so. In many variations of the Sicilian, Black makes a number of further pawn moves in the opening (for example, ...d6, ...e6, ...a6, and ...b5). Consequently, White often obtains a substantial lead in development and dangerous attacking chances.",1.e4 c5
44,French Defence,Opening,"The French Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves: 1. e4 e6\nThis is most commonly followed by 2.d4 d5. Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience, although some lines such as the Winawer Variation can lead to sharp complications. Black's position is often somewhat cramped in the early game; in particular, the pawn on e6 can impede the development of the bishop on c8, known by many players as the French bishop.",1.e4 e6
45,Caro-Kann Defence,Opening,"The Caro-Kann Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves: 1. e4 c6\nThe Caro-Kann is a common defence against 1.e4. It is classified as a Semi-Open Game, like the Sicilian Defence and French Defence, although it is thought to be more solid and less dynamic than either of those openings. It often leads to good endgames for Black, who has the better pawn structure.\nBlack prepares to contest the centre with 2...d5. Unlike the similarly motivated French Defence, the Caro-Kann does not hinder the development of Black's light-squared bishop. It comes at the cost of a tempo, however, because Black has to play 1...c6 before pushing the pawn to c5, whereas Black can push c7-c5 in one move in the French Defence. White can combat the Caro�Kann in several different ways, often gaining a space advantage; additionally, Black has less mobility and can lag in development.",1.e4 c6
46,Scandinavian Defence,Opening,"The Scandinavian Defense (or Center Counter Defense, or Center Counter Game) is a chess opening characterized by the moves: 1. e4 d5\nThe Scandinavian Defense, described in the poem Scachs d'amor, is the oldest opening by Black recorded in modern chess. Considered to be the most directly challenging move available to Black after 1.e4, the general goal of the defense is to prevent White from controlling the center of the board with pawns, effectively forcing an open game, while allowing Black to build a strong pawn structure.",1.e4 d5
47,Pirc Defence,Opening,"The Pirc Defence is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6\nThis is the most commonly played line after Black responds to 1.e4 with 1...d6. It has been claimed to give rise to somewhat interesting and exciting games, where Black will have counterplay but has to be cautious about playing too passively. According to Garry Kasparov, the Pirc Defence is ""hardly worth using in the tournaments of the highest category"", as it gives White ""too many opportunities for anybody's liking"".",1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6
48,Alekhine's Defence,Opening,"Alekhine's Defence is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 Nf6\nBlack tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn centre, with plans to undermine and attack the white structure later in the spirit of hypermodern defence. White's imposing mass of pawns in the centre often includes pawns on c4, d4, e5, and f4. Grandmaster Nick de Firmian observes of Alekhine's Defence in MCO-15 (2008), ""The game immediately loses any sense of symmetry or balance, which makes the opening a good choice for aggressive fighting players.""",1.e4 Nf6
49,Modern Defense,Opening,"The Modern Defense (also known as the Robatsch Defence after Karl Robatsch) is a hypermodern chess opening in which Black allows White to occupy the center with pawns on d4 and e4, then proceeds to attack and undermine this ""ideal"" center without attempting to occupy it. The Modern Defense usually starts with the opening moves: 1. e4 g6\nThe opening has been most notably used by British grandmasters Nigel Davies and Colin McNab. The Modern Defense is closely related to the Pirc Defence, the primary difference being that in the Modern, Black delays developing the knight to f6. The delay of ...Nf6 attacking White's pawn on e4 gives White the option of blunting the g7-bishop with c2-c3. There are numerous transpositional possibilities between the two openings.",1.e4 g6
50,Closed Game,Opening,"The openings classified as closed games begin 1.d4 d5. The move 1.d4 offers the same benefits to development and center control as does 1.e4, but unlike with King Pawn openings where the e4-pawn is undefended after the first move, the d4-pawn is protected by White's queen. This slight difference has a tremendous effect on the opening. For instance, whereas the King's Gambit is rarely played today at the highest levels of chess, the Queen's Gambit remains a popular weapon at all levels of play. Also, compared with the King Pawn openings, transpositions among variations are more common and critical in the closed games.",1.d4 d5
51,Queen's Gambit,Opening,"The Queen's Gambit is the chess opening that starts with the moves: 1. d4 d5 2. c4\nIt is one of the oldest openings and is still commonly played today. It is traditionally described as a gambit because White appears to sacrifice the c-pawn; however, this could be considered a misnomer as Black cannot retain the pawn without incurring a disadvantage.",1.d4 d5 2.c4
52,Queen's Gambit Accepted,Opening,"The Queen's Gambit Accepted (QGA) is a chess opening characterised by the moves: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4\nThe Queen's Gambit Accepted is the third most popular option on Black's second move, after 2...e6 (the Queen's Gambit Declined) and 2...c6 (the Slav Defense).\nThe Queen's Gambit is not considered a true gambit, in contrast to the King's Gambit, because the pawn is either regained, or can only be held unprofitably by Black. Black usually allows the pawn to be recaptured and uses the time expended to play against White's centre.",1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4
53,Queen's Gambit Declined,Opening,"The Queen's Gambit Declined (or QGD) is a chess opening in which Black declines a pawn offered by White in the Queen's Gambit: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6\nPlaying 2...e6 releases Black's dark-squared bishop, while obstructing Black's light-squared bishop. By declining White's temporary pawn sacrifice, Black erects a solid position; the pawns on d5 and e6 give Black a foothold in the center. The Queen's Gambit Declined has the reputation of being one of Black's most reliable defenses to 1.d4. In this situation, White will try to exploit the passivity of Black's light-squared bishop, and Black will try to release it, trade it, or prove that, while passive, the bishop has a useful defensive role.\nAn eventual ...dxc4 by Black will surrender the center to White, and Black will usually not do this unless Black can extract a concession, usually in the form of gaining a tempo, by capturing on c4 only after White has played Bd3 first. In the Orthodox Line, the fight for the tempo revolves around White's efforts to play all other useful developing moves prior to playing Bd3. Black will often aim for the pawn break ...c5 in this opening, which often leads to one or the other side accepting isolated or hanging pawns in exchange for dynamic compensation.",1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6
54,Slav Defense,Opening,"The Slav Defense is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6\nThe Slav is one of the primary defenses to the Queen's Gambit. Although it was analyzed as early as 1590, it was not until the 1920s that it started to be explored extensively, although Steinitz essayed it in the first official World Chess Championship of 1886. Many masters of Slavic descent helped develop the theory of this opening, including Alapin, Alekhine, Bogoljubov, and Vidmar.\nThe Slav received an exhaustive test during the two Alekhine�Euwe World Championship matches in 1935 and 1937. Played by 11 of the first 13 world champions, this defense was particularly favored by Euwe, Botvinnik, and Smyslov. More recently the Slav has been adopted by Anand, Ivanchuk, Lautier, Short, and other top grandmasters, including use in six of the eight games that Vladimir Kramnik played as Black in the 2006 World Championship (in the other two, he played the related Semi-Slav Defense).",1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6
55,Indian Defence,Opening,"In the game of chess, Indian Defence or Indian Game is a broad term for a group of openings characterised by the moves: 1. d4 Nf6\nThey are all to varying degrees hypermodern defences, where Black invites White to establish an imposing presence in the centre with the plan of undermining and ultimately destroying it. Although the Indian defences were championed in the 1920s by players in the hypermodern school, they were not fully accepted until Russian players showed in the late 1940s that these systems are sound for Black. Since then, the Indian defences have become a popular way for Black to respond to 1.d4 because they often offer a balanced game with winning chances for both sides.",1.d4 Nf6
56,Modern Benoni,Opening,"The Modern Benoni is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6. After the initial moves, Black proceeds to capture on d5, creating a majority of black pawns on the queenside. To support their advance, the king's bishop is usually fianchettoed on g7. These two features differentiate Black's setup from the other Benoni defences and the King's Indian Defence, although transpositions between these openings are common.",1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6
57,Benko Gambit,Opening,The Benko Gambit (or Volga Gambit) is a chess opening characterised by the move 3...b5 in the Benoni Defence arising after: 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5\nBlack sacrifices a pawn for enduring queenside pressure. White can accept or decline the gambit pawn.,1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5
58,Nimzo-Indian Defence,Opening,"The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves: 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4\nThis hypermodern opening was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch who introduced it to master-level chess in the early 20th century. Unlike most Indian openings, the Nimzo-Indian does not involve an immediate fianchetto, although Black often follows up with ...b6 and ...Bb7. By pinning White's knight, Black prevents the threatened 4.e4 and seeks to inflict doubled pawns on White. White will attempt to create a pawn centre and develop their pieces to prepare for an assault on the Black position.",1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4
59,Queen's Indian Defense,Opening,"The Queen's Indian Defense (QID) is a chess opening defined by the moves: 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6\nThe opening is a solid defense to the Queen's Pawn Game.[2] 3...b6 increases Black's control over the central light squares e4 and d5 by preparing to fianchetto the queen's bishop, with the opening deriving its name from this maneuver. As in the other Indian defenses, Black attempts to control the center with pieces in hypermodern style, instead of occupying it with pawns in classical style.",1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6
60,Catalan Opening,Opening,"The Catalan Opening is a chess opening where White plays d4 and c4 and fianchettoes the white bishop on g2. A common opening sequence is 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3, although various other openings can transpose into the Catalan.\nIn the Catalan, White adopts a combination of the Queen's Gambit and Reti Opening. White combines the space-gaining moves d4 and c4 with g3, preparing to fianchetto the king's bishop. This places pressure mainly on the queenside while hoping to keep the white king safe in the long-term. The c4-pawn can become vulnerable, however, and White might have to sacrifice a pawn.\nBlack has two main approaches to play against the Catalan: in the Open Catalan Black plays ...dxc4 and can either try to hold on to the pawn with ...b5 or give it back for extra time to free their game. In the Closed Catalan, Black does not capture on c4; their game can be somewhat cramped for a while, but is quite solid. Additionally, Black has ways to avoid the Catalan.",1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3
61,Gruenfeld Defence,Opening,"The Gruenfeld Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves: 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5\nBlack offers White the possibility of 4.cxd5, which may be followed by 4...Nxd5 and 5.e4, giving White an imposing central pawn duo. If White does not take the d5-pawn, Black may eventually play ...dxc4, when a White response of e4 again leads to the same pawn structure. In classical opening theory this imposing pawn centre was held to give White a large advantage, but the hypermodern school, which was coming to the fore in the 1920s, held that a large pawn centre could be a liability rather than an asset. The Gr�nfeld is therefore a key hypermodern opening, showing in stark terms how a large pawn centre can either be a powerful battering ram or a target for attack.",1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5
62,King's Indian Defence,Opening,"The King's Indian Defence (or KID) is a common chess opening. It is defined by the following moves: 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6\nBlack intends to follow up with 3...Bg7 and 4...d6 (the Gruenfeld Defence arises when Black plays 3...d5 instead and is considered a separate opening). White's major third move options are 3.Nc3, 3.Nf3, or 3.g3, with both the King's Indian and Gruenfeld playable against these moves.\nThe King's Indian is a hypermodern opening, where Black deliberately allows White control of the centre with pawns, with the view to subsequently challenge it. In the most critical lines of the King's Indian, White erects an imposing pawn centre with Nc3 followed by e4. Black stakes out their own claim to the centre with the Benoni-style ...c5, or ...e5. If White resolves the central pawn tension with d5, then Black follows with either ...b5 and queenside play, or ...f5 and an eventual kingside attack. Meanwhile, White attempts to expand on the opposite wing. The resulting unbalanced positions offer scope for both sides to play for a win.",1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6
